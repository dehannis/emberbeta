## CONTEXT OF PROJECT

- you'll have 1 mcp tool you can use for the research portion of this project: Figma Desktop MCP
- and another tool you can use for the implementation portion of this project: TalkToFigma MCP

we need to design/create the frames, layers, components, animations, and interactions in figma for a user journey outlined in the following figjams:

- 0. Backend Schema: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 1. Lo-fi UI: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-2998&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 2. Less Lo-fi UI: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-2999&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 3a. Lo-fi UX: going back/forwards in time: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-4728&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 3b. Lo-fi UX: switching to a different creator's timeline: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-3001&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 3c. Lo-fi UX: clicking the shuffle button to jump to a random memory on active creator's timeline: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-3002&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 4. Mid-fi Mockup: <https://www.figma.com/board/elBFplPOzBmaJnbcFJ5DxG/Remember-View?node-id=4-3003&p=f&t=rqEzuLOOjXKqAAjK-11>
- 5. Hi-fi mockup for desktop: <https://www.figma.com/design/P9ZetOmtLwAhTriE1h8L8P/EMBER-PROJECT-gco?node-id=1-4199&t=C9fYzSL3Xec0aDH3-11>
- 1. Hi-fi mockup for mobile: <https://www.figma.com/design/P9ZetOmtLwAhTriE1h8L8P/EMBER-PROJECT-gco?node-id=1-4199&t=C9fYzSL3Xec0aDH3-11>

these are meant to be read in sequential order. 


## YOUR TO-DOS
- First, review the specs (for this project, we're focusing just on the layers/frames/components/animations/effects created in figma -> frontend codeability. we're not focused on backend.) and if you have any clarifying questions ask me them.
- it's CRITICAL that the horizontal scroll/swipe swipe and revolver physics is flawless.

## ROADMAP AFTER initial TO-D0s scoped for this plan completed
1. code the design in frontend
2. test interactions/experience
