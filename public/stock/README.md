# Stock photos for memory panes

Add any images you want to use as “stock photos” for Build’s glass panes into this folder.

## How to use
- Put files here, e.g.:
  - `public/stock/1.webp`
  - `public/stock/2.webp`
  - `public/stock/3.webp`

- Then reference them from a memory’s `photoUrl`:
  - `photoUrl: "stock/1.webp"` (recommended)
  - `photoUrl: "/stock/1.webp"` (also supported; auto-migrated)

Notes:
- Prefer **`.webp`** for best quality/size.
- You can name files however you want as long as `photoUrl` matches.
